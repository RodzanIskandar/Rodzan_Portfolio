# [Project 4: Analyzing Man Fashions in E-commerce Shopee Indonesia](https://github.com/RodzanIskandar/analyzing_man_fashions_in_e-commerce_Shopee_Indonesia)

I am scraped over 2000 product postings in sales man's fashion and answering some questions like what is the suitable sub-category market for newcomers in Shopee Indonesia? what is the most effective store? etc.
