# [Project 1: Analyzing Man Fashions in E-commerce Shopee Indonesia](https://github.com/RodzanIskandar/analyzing_man_fashions_in_e-commerce_Shopee_Indonesia)
This project's idea is based on customers and seller responses about regulatory delivery system change by Shopee Indonesia in their e-commerce system who encourage some of the users to switch the platform. The main idea is to get a bigger picture of the man's fashion market in Shopee Indonesia and compare it with another e-commerce platform to see the market opportunity within the same category. I am scraped over 2000 product postings in sales man's fashion from https://shopee.co.id/Pakaian-Pria-cat.33?page=0&sortBy=sales and answering some questions like what is the suitable sub-category market for newcomers in Shopee Indonesia? what is the most effective store? etc.
