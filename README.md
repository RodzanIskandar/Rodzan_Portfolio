# [Project 1: IDcard detection and OCR](https://github.com/RodzanIskandar/IDcard_detection_and_OCR)
The main idea of this projects is to simplify administration process in indonesia using existing id card. This idea comes up cause there are complicated administration process in Indonesia especially in the state administrative affairs for civilians. So here I am designed the ID card detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to its able to detect and record the information into csv file using camera. To detect the idcard I am using Tensorflow object detection algortihm with SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite 320x320 as pretrained model from Tensorflow. In order to detect the characters on the id card, I am using library easyocr based on pytorch.

# [Project 2: Vidio.com stream dataset](https://github.com/RodzanIskandar/Vidio_stream_dataset)
I am analyzing and build recommendation engine using real Vidio.com play dataset from 1 february 2020 to 16 february 2020. One of insights from the analytis is most play are in embed (not direct) with less play duration, play by non premium users coming from some refferers and campaigns. It shows there are still many opportunities to attract non-premium users to become premium users. Based on Feature Importances, title and has_ad as the 2 top biggest impact in user bceome premium, so by improving the quality of the content and ads can increase the premium users. In the build recommendation system I am using collaborative filtering method using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and completed play data by premium user.

# [Project 3: Analyzing Man Fashions in E-commerce Shopee Indonesia](https://github.com/RodzanIskandar/analyzing_man_fashions_in_e-commerce_Shopee_Indonesia)
This project's idea is based on customers and seller responses about regulatory delivery system change by Shopee Indonesia in their e-commerce system who encourage some of the users to switch the platform. The main idea is to get a bigger picture of the man's fashion market in Shopee Indonesia and compare it with another e-commerce platform to see the market opportunity within the same category. I am scraped over 2000 product postings in sales man's fashion and answering some questions like what is the suitable sub-category market for newcomers in Shopee Indonesia? what is the most effective store? etc.

# [Project 4: Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/RodzanIskandar/used_craiglist_car_price_prediction)
In this project, I am designing a machine learning regression model to able to predict used car prices according to Craiglist website data. So the seller can estimate their used car price based on car specifications and condition. The final result of this project is a simple website API so user can use directly in website to predict their used car.

# [Project 5: Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://github.com/RodzanIskandar/Airline_Passenger_satisfaction)
The Dataset contains an Airline Satisfaction Passenger survey from Kaggle dataset. The purpose of this analysis is to get insights into what factors are highly correlated to a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger, and also can the data predict the passenger satisfaction. From Data Analysis result, The Airlines passenger satisfaction is dominant by the older people within range of the age between 40 - 60 for the business travel using business-class within long flying range distance, which supported and reinforced by good services score for older people like seat comfort, on-board service, and legroom. and also in Machine Learning modeling, the model got 96% precision to predict passenger satisfaction using the Support Vector Classifier.

# [Project 6: Power BI Dashboard E-commerce Transaction](https://github.com/RodzanIskandar/PowerBI_dashboard_e-commerce_transaction)
I am processing the e-commerce transaction data from the newcomer's e-commerce platform to get some insights into the business. An example of the insights is the fact that transactions mostly happened between 10 am to 15 pm, therefore the company can make some data-driven decisions like marketing campaigns in that range of time. cause in this project focusing on data analytics, so the final output of this project is Power BI dashboard to be able to share some insights to all stakeholders in the business.
